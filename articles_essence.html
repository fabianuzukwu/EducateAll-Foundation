Giving with love is the key to success, fulfillment, and a life of prosperity.<br> The world needs people who go into the world and give their all to aid in the betterment of society. People need to stand up and start adding value to other people’s lives by being of service and living selflessly. Someone wrote and I quote, <em>”We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”</em> Winston Churchill.<br> Giving is the key access to receiving back in abundance be it directly or indirectly. The true mark of prosperity is generosity given from a good heart, a heart that is unconditional but conditioned to show love and kindness to others at all times.

Giving is also an act of honour and no one gives without getting back. A child is an innocent part of Life and giving hope to one makes even God happy. Hence, the act of Giving with a good heart is an exceptional degree of love. <br>A billionaire who gives away nothing is poorer than a poor person who gives away $10. In fact, the poor person who gives away $10 is $10 richer than the billionaire who gives away nothing.

Conscious selfless living is the best way to live a life of impact and true fulfilment. And reaching out to help those who are in need when we have the capacity to do so is the best form of strategy for longevity and prosperity.<br>

Kathy Calvin wrote and I quote, <em>“Giving is not just about making a donation. It is about making a difference.”</em> It will be nice to remind us that life is in phases and men are in sizes, and no one gets poor by giving. If giving and showing love and kindness are not part of the essence of living, then the world would be the worst of what we expect because; the poor and needy we reject and refuse to show love and kindness today might end up reaching out to us in different turn tomorrow.<br> The children out there that we intend to reach out to through your benevolence are going to live and have a true sense of belonging because you made it possible for them to be educated.

<br>One thing to note about giving also is that when we give to anyone in need we have given to God through that needy person. And interestingly, life is short, death is sure, only what we do for God will LAST...“For it is in giving that we receive.” <br>Thank you in anticipation of your giving towards the sponsorship and giving of hope to a child.</p>
