                10 year-old John has a dream to become a software developer. Ever since he could string sentences together, he has been curious about the workings of the computer. He personally nicknamed himself “Baby Computer” and everyone in the neighborhood called him that. Unfortunately his only contact with a computer was when a non-profit organisation visited his primary school and gave him and his classmates a short introduction to computers and left them with illustrated pocket books on computers afterwards.<br> His parents can’t afford to own a computer nor send him to a school where he can learn more. In fact, if the next farming season yields a poor harvest, “Baby Computer” may be withdrawn from school to work in menial labour in order to help support his family. <br>   John’s case is not peculiar nor new. His situation is illustrative of the lives of millions of children in most third world nations. Access to quality education for all is such a big ticket global issue; big enough to motivate nation states both individually and under the umbrella of the UN to do something about it. This among other global issues, gave birth to the Sustainable Development Goals <br>It is no surprise that Education is an important component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that all United Nations country member states are expected to work towards achieving. According to UN’s dedicated SDG website, “Despite the considerable progress on education access and participation over the past years, 262 million children and youth aged 6 to 17 were still out of school in 2017...Refocused efforts are needed to improve learning outcomes for the full life cycle, especially for women, girls and marginalized people in vulnerable settings.” <br> There is a lot to be done and the burden cannot be left totally to the government of the day. EducateAll Foundation has taken up the challenge to create opportunities for children like John to acquire an education that will help them to fulfil their dreams. Our goal is to educate 1000 children in the next ten years with donations and gifts from willing donors through transparent and technology-driven collection process.
