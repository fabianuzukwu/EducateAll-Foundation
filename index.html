				YOUR DONATIONS <br /> CAN CHANGE LIVES
			</h3>
			<p>
				According to the UNICEF, one in every five of the world’s out-of-school children is in Nigeria. 
				Furthermore, statistics put 10.5 million as the number of the country’s children aged between 5-14 years that are not in school. Only 61 percent of 6-11 year-olds regularly attend primary school and only 35.6 percent of children aged 36-59 months receive early childhood education. 
				This paints a dire picture and the best time to have done something about this was decades ago. The next best time however, is NOW! EducateAll Foundation is a non-profit organization driven by the sole purpose of securing the future of indigent children through quality education. The Foundation is committed to providing opportunities for out-of-school children to access education as a means of overcoming socio-economic challenges. 
				This it does through crowd-sourced funding and donations in transparent, technology-driven processes. It is our strong belief that education can shape lives and societies for the better.
