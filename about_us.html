These include school bags, school supplies, shoes, etc. *Sponsor a Child Sponsor a Child project creates a unique relationship between you and your sponsored child. One Child for One Year, whether it is donations via school supplies or monetary donations you can make a long-lasting impact and build on a relationship that includes the family and communities.
